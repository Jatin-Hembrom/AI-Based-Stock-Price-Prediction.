# AI-Based-Stock-Price-Prediction.
Leverage machine learning and deep learning techniques to forecast stock prices based on historical data and technical indicators. This project demonstrates how AI models such as LSTM, GRU, and Transformer architectures can be applied to time series forecasting in the financial domain.
Features
 >> Multiple ML/DL models (Linear Regression, LSTM, GRU, Transformers)
 >> Technical indicators (MACD, RSI, Moving Averages, etc.)
 >> Real-time data fetching from Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage
 >> Backtesting with performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, RÂ²)
 >> Interactive visualizations with Plotly or Matplotlib
 >> Modular and extensible codebase
